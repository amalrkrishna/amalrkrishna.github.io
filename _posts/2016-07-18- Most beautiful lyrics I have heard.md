<p align="justify">I went through my playlist once and picked out some songs whose lyrics meant a great deal to me. Most of these lines are very simple, all of it makes it into my list because: Either I liked the whole lyrics of the song or just the part I have mentioned, or I was able to relate to the lines in these lines somehow, or because of a movie or TV series I have watched, and some of these lines reciprocate the way I see the world. So, like I said, the list is just a personal one. :)</p>

<ol>
<li><b>All of Me, John Legend</b></li><i>
    Love your curves and all your edges<br>
    All your perfect imperfections<br>
    Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you<br>
    You're my end and my beginning<br>
    Even when I lose , I'm winning<br>
    'Cause I give you all of me<br>
    And you give me all of you, oh<br>

</i><br><li><b>As long as you love me, Backstreet Boys </b></li><i>
 
    Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine<br>
    I'm leavin' my life in your hands<br>
    People say I'm crazy and that I am blind<br>
    Risking it all in a glance<br>
    And how you got me blind is still a mystery<br>
    I can't get your out of my head<br>
    Don't care what is written in your history<br>
    As long as you're here with me<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Bad Day, Daniel Powter </b></li><i>
 
    You stand in the line just ahead of the law<br>
    You're faking a smile with the coffee you go<br>
    You tell me your life's been way off line<br>
    You're falling to pieces every time<br>
    And I don't need no carryin' on<br>
    Cause you had a bad day<br>
    You're taking one down<br>
    You sing a sad song just to turn it around<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Green Day </b></li><i>
 
    My shadow's the only one that walks beside me<br>
    My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating<br>
    Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me<br>
    Till then I walk alone<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Bring me to life, Evanescence </b></li><i>
 
    How can you see into my eyes like open doors<br>
    Leading you down into my core<br>
    Where I've become so numb without a soul<br>
    My spirit sleeping somewhere cold<br>
    Until you find it there and lead it back home<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Comfortable Numb, Pink Floyd </b></li><i>
 
    There is no pain, you are receding<br>
    A distant ship's smoke on the horizon<br>
    You are only coming though in waves<br>
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Earth Song, Michael Jackson </b></li><i>
 
    What about sunrise<br>
    What about rain<br>
    What about all the things<br>
    That you said we were to gain...<br>
    What about killing fields<br>
    Is there a time<br>
    What about all the things<br>
    That you said was yours and mine...<br>
    Did you ever stop to notice<br>
    All the blood we've shed before<br>
    Did you ever stop to notice<br>
    The crying Earth the weeping shores?<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>(Everything I Do) I Do It For You, Bryan Adams </b></li><i>
 
    Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for<br>
    You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for<br>
    You know it's true<br>
    Everything I do, I do it for you<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Fix You, Coldplay </b></li><i>
 
    And high up above or down below<br>
    When you're too in love to let it go<br>
    But if you never try you'll never know<br>
    Just what you're worth<br>

    Lights will guide you home<br>
    And ignite your bones<br>
    And I will try to fix you<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Good Riddance, Green Day </b></li><i>
 
    So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind<br>
    Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time<br>
    Tattoos and memories and dead skin on trial<br>
    For what it's worth it was worth all the while<br>

    It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,<br>
    I hope you had the time of your life<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Heal the World, Michael Jackson </b></li><i>
 
    There's a place in your heart<br>
    And I know that it is love<br>
    And this place could be much<br>
    Brighter than tomorrow<br>
    And if you really try<br>
    You'll find there's no need to cry<br>
    In this place you'll feel<br>
    There's no hurt or sorrow..<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Hey Jude, The Beatles </b></li><i>
 
    Hey Jude, don't make it bad<br>
    Take a sad song and make it better<br>
    Remember to let her into your heart<br>
    Then you can start to make it better<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Hotel California, Eagles </b></li><i>
 
    Mirrors on the ceiling,<br>
    The pink champagne on ice<br>
    And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"<br>
    And in the master's chambers,<br>
    They gathered for the feast<br>
    They stab it with their steely knives,<br>
    But they just can't kill the beast<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>I'll Be There For You, The Rembrandts </b></li><i>
 
    No one could ever know me<br>
    No one could ever see me<br>
    Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me<br>
    Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with<br>
    Someone I'll always laugh with<br>
    Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah!<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>In The End, Linkin Park </b></li><i>
 
    Time is a valuable thing<br>
    Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
    Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
    The clock ticks life away<br>
    It’s so unreal<br>
    Didn’t look out below<br>
    Watch the time go right out the window<br>
    Trying to hold on but didn’t even know<br>
    I wasted it all just to watch you go<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Is This love, Bob Marley </b></li><i>
 
    I wanna love you and treat you right<br>
    I wanna love you every day and every night<br>
    We'll be together with a roof right over our heads<br>
    We'll share the shelter of my single bed<br>
    We'll share the same room, yeah! - for Jah provide the bread<br>
    Is this love - is this love - is this love<br>
    Is this love that I'm feelin'?<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Kashmir, Led Zeppelin </b></li><i>
 
    Oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream<br>
    I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been<br>
    To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen<br>
    They talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Let It Be, The Beatles </b></li><i>
 
    When I find myself in times of trouble<br>
    Mother Mary comes to me<br>
    Speaking words of wisdom, let it be<br>
    And in my hour of darkness<br>
    She is standing right in front of me<br>
    Speaking words of wisdom, let it be<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Lose Yourself, Eminem </b></li><i>
 
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment<br>
    You own it, you better never let it go<br>
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Mad World, Gary Jules </b></li><i>
 
    And I find it kinda funny<br>
    I find it kinda sad<br>
    The dreams in which I'm dying<br>
    Are the best I've ever had<br>
    I find it hard to tell you<br>
    I find it hard to take<br>
    When people run in circles<br>
    It's a very, very mad world, mad world<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Nothing Else Matters, Metallica </b></li><i>
 
    So close no matter how far<br>
    Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
    Forever trusting who we are<br>
    And nothing else matters<br>

    Never cared for what they do<br>
    Never cared for what they know<br>
    But I know<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>November Rain, Guns n' Roses </b></li><i>
 
    'Cause nothin' lasts forever<br>
    And we both know hearts can change<br>
    And it's hard to hold a candle<br>
    In the cold November rain<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Photograph, Ed Sheeran </b></li><i>
 
    We keep this love in a photograph<br>
    We made these memories for ourselves<br>
    Where our eyes are never closing<br>
    Hearts are never broken<br>
    Times forever frozen still<br>

    So you can keep me<br>
    Inside the pocket<br>
    Of your ripped jeans<br>
    Holdin' me closer<br>
    'Til our eyes meet<br>
    You won't ever be alone<br>
    Wait for me to come home<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Rolling in the Deep, Adele </b></li><i>
 
    There's a fire starting in my heart<br>
    Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark<br>
    Finally I can see you crystal clear<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Set fire to the Rain, Adele </b></li><i>
 
    But I set fire to the rain,<br>
    Watched it pour as I touched your face,<br>
    Well, it burned while I cried<br>
    'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Shadow of the Day, Linkin Park </b></li><i>
 
    I close both locks below the window<br>
    I close both blinds and turn away<br>
    Sometimes solutions aren't so simple<br>
    Sometimes goodbye's the only way<br>
    And the sun will set for you<br>
    The sun will set for you<br>
    And the shadow of the day<br>
    Will embrace the world in grey<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Show me the meaning of being lonely, Backstreet Boys </b></li><i>
 
    So many words for the broken heart<br>
    It's hard to see in a crimson love<br>
    So hard to breathe<br>
    Walk with me, and maybe<br>
    Nights of light so soon become<br>
    Wild and free I could feel the sun<br>
    Your every wish will be done<br>
    They tell me<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Somebody that I used to know, Gotye </b></li><i>
 
    But you didn't have to cut me off<br>
    Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing<br>
    And I don't even need your love<br>
    But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough<br>
    No you didn't have to stoop so low<br>
    Have your friends collect your records and then change your number<br>
    I guess that I don't need that though<br>
    Now you're just somebody that I used to know<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Stairway to Heaven, Led Zeppelin </b></li><i>
 
    Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run<br>
    There’s still time to change the road you’re on<br>
    And it makes me wonder<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Summer of 69, Bryan Adams </b></li><i>
 
    Oh, when I look back now<br>
    That summer seemed to last forever<br>
    And if I had the choice<br>
    Yeah, I'd always wanna be there<br>
    Those were the best days of my life<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>That's the way it is, Celine Dion </b></li><i>
 
    When you want it the most there's no easy way out<br>
    When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt<br>
    Don't give up on your faith<br>
    Love comes to those who believe it<br>
    And that's the way it is<br>

</i><br><li><b>Thinking out loud, Ed Sheeran </b></li><i>
 
    Take me into your loving arms<br>
    Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars<br>
    Place your head on my beating heart<br>
    I'm thinking out loud<br>
    Maybe we found love right where we are<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Time, Pink Floyd </b></li><i>
 
    Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time<br>
    Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines<br>
    Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way<br>
    The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Viva La Vida, Coldplay </b></li><i>
 
    I used to rule the world<br>
    Seas would rise when I gave the word<br>
    Now in the morning I sleep alone<br>
    Sweep the streets I used to own<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>Wake me up when September ends, Green Day </b></li><i>
 
    Here comes the rain again<br>
    Falling from the stars<br>
    Drenched in my pain again<br>
    Becoming who we are<br>
    As my memory rests<br>
    But never forgets what I lost<br>
    Wake me up when September ends<br>
 

</i><br><li><b>With or without you, U2 </b></li><i>
 
    See the stone set in your eyes<br>
    See the thorn twist in your side<br>
    I wait for you<br>
    Sleight of hand and twist of fate<br>
    On a bed of nails she makes me wait<br>
    And I wait, without you<br>
    With or without you<br>
 

</ol>
