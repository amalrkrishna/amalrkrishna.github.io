<p align="justify">The best way to predict the future is to study past behavior. This is the underlying idea behind big data analytics. The 2008 Obama election campaign was one of the first to take advantage of data-driven methods in the race to an elected office. The Obama campaign had a data analytics team of 100 people. This shows how deeply data analytics impacts the world. From recommending products to customers on e-commerce websites (i.e. using predictive analytics) to electing the most powerful official of the free world. Big Data Analytics is indeed everywhere. Data analytics has evolved itself to become the brain of every election campaign since the Obama campaign. Data analytics helps the election campaign to understand the voters better and hence adapt to their sentiments. Now let’s find out how data analytics affects the elections and how election campaigns use it.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>How Data Analytics affects the election?</b></li>

<p align="justify">The 2016 race to the White House had data at its center and made itself an unstoppable force. The question here is how it affects the outcome of the election? Positively or Negatively? In other words, does data analytics have the ability to turn election results?
Social and polling data can affect the voters.</p>

<p align="justify">Social websites such as Facebook and Twitter optimize their feeds to the target audience to promote voting. Conversely, you see Hillary Clinton leading by 73% chance to take over the White House in the polls (released by some analytics firm) to Trump. In reality, would you agree that a good number of people would feel that the election result is obvious now?</p>

<p align="justify">As a result, I feel that there will be a negative impact on the voter turnout in such situations. Websites like Five Thirty Eight and Real Clear Politics use social, polling data to predict the election results. To emphasize, if they tweak those results in favor of a single candidate, then it can give an altogether different perspective to their millions of followers, who now after knowing the probable outcome may not turn out at the booths to support their candidate. Hence, it is crucial to realize the downside as well.</p>

<li><b>How election campaigns make use of Data Analytics?</b></li>

<p align="justify">There are two sub divisions of extracting data for an election campaign. Firstly, social data and polling data and secondly public data which becomes a part of Big Data. Firstly, this helps the candidate to understand the voters better and design the campaign accordingly. Moreover, this brings more clarity to the election campaign. Both Clinton’s and Trump’s campaigns are relying on technology for reaching out to the voters in the 2016 race to The White House. The Campaign job distribution for both Hillary and Trump Campaign obtained from ValuePengiun is shown below. We can observe from the graph that Data Analytics and the resulting Strategic Operations takes up a huge chunk of the workforce of both the presidential campaigns.</p>

<li>Identifying the Swing States</li>

A swing state is a state where the two major political parties have similar levels of support among voters, viewed as important in determining the overall result of a presidential election. Swing states are one of the most important factors in the US elections. Red states are ones that are dominated by the Republicans (i.e. Trump’s party) whereas the blue ones signify the dominance of the Democrats (i.e. Clinton’s party). Hence swing states are also known as purple states as both parties have similar electoral support in these areas.

Large amounts of public data, polling data, sentimental analysis of Twitter and Facebook feeds are used to determine the swing states. In particular, winning the swing states can make a big difference in the electoral votes. These are the best opportunity for a party to gain electoral votes. So, political parties majorly focus on these states while strategizing their election campaign. In the 2016 US Presidential elections the 12 swing states are:- Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Colorado, Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Florida, Michigan, and North Carolina. “Tipping-point chance” as described by FiveThirtyEight is the probability that a state will provide the decisive vote in the Electoral College. This is a good indicator of the Swing states.

<li>Online and offline marketing</li>

Using big data analytics, the election campaign analyzes the demographics of the states where they fall behind their opposition. Offline marketing like billboards and television ads is deployed strategically to target the audience using data analytics. It helps them to understand the states where the campaign needs to improve on the marketing and hence turn the voter sentiments around.

<li><b>Big Players in the Election Forecast</b></li>

Now, let’s look at some of the notable players who use data analytics on polling, social and big data for the forecast.

<ul>
<li>Five Thirty Eight</li>

In 2007, Nate Silver launched Five Thirty Eight. Silver made data analytics super cool with his famous 2008 US Presidential election predictions. Five Thirty Eight’s 2008 presidential election forecast had 98.08% accuracy in predicting the winners in each of the states. Notably, they correctly predicted the winner of 49 of the 50 states including the District of Columbia. On the whole, Indiana is the only state in which they missed out. Five Thirty Eight's prediction on "chance of winning" for the 2016 election cycle is shown below.

<li>Real Clear Politics</li>

John McIntyre and Tom Bevan founded RCP in 2000. They are one of the leading websites which collects a lot of polling data and generates a predictive analytical model for the forecast.

<li>Conclusion</li>

We are in the midst of yet another US Presidential election which is due to take place on 8th November 2016. To sum up, we have seen how highly data analytics is used by election campaigns and how it affects elections as a whole. Additionally, this also opens a whole world of possibilities on how someone can be a part of such a technological field with great impact.

<li><b>The rising price of higher education</b></li>
<p align="justify">The average cost of attending a good university in the US now for Bachelor's is roughly 25000$/yr in public universities and around 45000$/yr in private universities. The same for a Master's program is somewhere around 30% more than Bachelor's per year. Even though the cost of attending universities in countries like India and China is far less, we have to accept the fact that most of the top universities are located in the first world countries. It's every student's dream to study at one of the best universities in the world. So just like that, the top universities always come at a higher price which puts the students in debt at the end of the degree.</p>

<li><b>How many degrees does it take?</b></li>
<p align="justify">It's fairly safe to assume that the person's knowledge and expertise in the field accounts more, rather than blindly looking at the number of degrees he/she possesses. I guess everyone would agree with me on that. Nevertheless, having degrees are important. They do help a lot for job interviews etc. If we look at the past, even having a single degree would have kept the person apart from the crowd. This was decades ago. Now in this 21st century, having a single degree has become too mainstream. We have more than 3 million Bachelor's degree graduates passing out, from India/China alone. In order for people to keep up with the demand, now most people either do an MS or an MBA as well. Maybe, even a Master's degree can become very common after 10 years. By the time you are done with Bachelor's and Master's, you would have shelled out a good sum of money especially if it's from the first world countries.</p>

<li><b>The Internet as a medium</b></li>
<p align="justify">There has been a surge in the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in the past 3 years. This is mainly due to the rise of websites like <a href="http://coursera.org/" target="_blank">coursera</a>, 
<a href="http://edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a>, 
<a href="http://udacity.com/" target="_blank">udacity</a> etc. Now students can learn from the best instructors from the top universities in a much cheaper educational model. There is no doubt that determined students learn a lot from this medium. Apart from individual courses they have even started nano degrees provided to the students. But is it possible to really certify these courses? Are they credible in the eyes of a potential employer or an admission's committee? As of now, the simple answer would be a plain 'No'. This has become a medium of education even for working professionals. For example, educational models such as 
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a> which provide a monthly/yearly subscription access to Industry oriented courses or 
<a href="http://upxacademy.com/" target="_blank">UpX</a> which teach industry oriented courses as batches in real-time online classes. Still, most of these models lack the kind of procured environment and interaction that the traditional classroom teaching guarantees.</p>

<li><b>The blend of Online and Traditional model</b></li>
<p align="justify">Just like people count money after taking it out from the ATM, no matter how much you try, it's very difficult to trust an automated model even it's good. Nevertheless, I believe the future of higher education lies in perfectly balancing the Online and Traditional models. The educational websites would optimize the courses in a more procured grading environments. Students won't be able to complete a course by just hit and trails like now in <a href="http://coursera.org/" target="_blank">coursera</a>. Every attempt would start to matter. As we move forward, this model will become more credible with mandatory webcam procured examinations etc. As the courses become more credible, students will have the option to transfer these courses  as credits to their traditional university credits. The absence of Infrastructure and physical faculty presence in credit hours will bring down the combined cost of attendance. With the rise of Virtual Computing Labs(VCL), even majority of the technical lab sessions will be done and evaluated online. Purely online nano degrees would become more credible and common. Semi-online degrees would start to emerge with online credit transfer. Many arts/science degrees and courses will still require you to follow the traditional model. For example, go to labs, burn some resistors or break some test tubes and learn from your mistakes. This is my take on the future of higher education at the end of next 10 years.</p>
