<p align="justify">During June 2016, I was randomly searching for Opensource projects so that I could get involved in one of them. This search led me to some projects in GitHub but frankly I was a bit skeptical about how I could get associated at that point. After a few days, I randomly stumbled upon this entry level position in RedHat, Pune under Quality Engineering (QE) and applied for it on June 4th. I also applied under Software Maintenance Engineering (SME) and Predictive Analysis (PA) in RedHat. I sent the applications out of the blue from there <a href="http://redhat.jobs/" target="_blank">site</a>.
I just saw it and sent it. I did not sent to other companies due to lack of interest. Why I sent to RedHat was because, throughout my search for projects in the Opensource domain, there was one name that was almost everywhere and it was RedHat. RedHat is one of the largest companies contributing actively to Opensource projects like Fedora, OpenStack, OpenShift to name a few. I also did a bit more research and found out some interesting facts which further encouraged me to apply to them. RedHat is one of the top 10 preferred software companies to work for as per <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/06/15/the-best-software-companies-to-work-for-in-2015/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> in 2015. The company strength~8000 is not so huge nor too small. I felt that it is was a very good equilibrium such that you get to contribute at a relatively higher level in the company and get your voices heard effectively. I also saw someone saying that working in RedHat is quite different compared to any other Multi-National or any start-up, it's more like putting ourselves in the middle of 100 start-ups, which I found quite fascinating.</p> 

<p align="justify">On June 15th, I received a mail from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soni-lonari-97096751" target="_blank">Soni Lonari</a> informing me that I was shortlisted for the SME position but did not receive any reply to the couple of reverts I sent to that mail. After two days I tried calling RedHat, pune office using the number I got from their website. I called them like 2-3 times, and a woman picked up the call everytime. She told me she worked as a security there and was unaware of anything. She could hardly communicate in English and I was not strong in Hindi to make it worse but somehow managed to convey the message so that it could be informed to Soni. I felt that, being a reputed company RedHat should have employed someone with good communication skills and knows how to divert the calls efficiently to deal with the general contact number. I got a call from Soni after a couple of days notifying me about the position and basic requirements but SME changed to QE for some reason. I still have no idea how that happened but she was nice and talked me through most of the things I needed to know. I parallelly got a rejection mail from Predictive Analysis (PA), maybe I was not qualified enough or it might be because I was already shortlisted for QE. To be frank, the name PA interested me more than QE at first. I thought maybe it had to do with some sort of prediction stuff and I could learn to interact with some machine learning concepts. After that, I checked out QE further and I found that to be equally interesting as well. Since I was staying in Trivandrum, Soni had informed me that they would be setting up telephonic/video interview for the application process. All the scheduling of my interviews were handled by 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepti-bisen-kulkarni-29789a25" target="_blank">Deepti Kulkarni</a>. She was very friendly thoughout and I noticed that her middle name was different in her Linkedin profile (Bisen) and the one from her RedHat mail (Mihir). I was basically jobless then, so upon searching I got to know that 'Bisen' are a powerful and an ancient Rajput clan (Raj Vansha) named after Raja Birsen (hence Bisen) of the Suket Kingdom and have several kingdoms in the northern plains of India. Related? maybe. maybe not. Anyway coming back to my interview, she kept me posted about the application process every week.</p>
