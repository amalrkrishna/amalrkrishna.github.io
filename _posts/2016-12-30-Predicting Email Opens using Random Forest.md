<p align="justify">This is the documentation for Predicting Email Opens question of the Machine Learning Codesprint Competition conducted by HackerRank. <br>

The problem statement is as follows:<br>

We will provide you with metadata for emails sent to HackerRank users over a certain period of time. This metadata contains specific information about:
<ul>
<li>The user the email was sent to.</li>
<li>The email that was sent.</li>
<li>The user's reaction to the email, including (among other things) whether or not the user opened the email.</li>
</ul>

Given the metadata for additional future emails, you must predict whether or not each user will open an email.<br>
