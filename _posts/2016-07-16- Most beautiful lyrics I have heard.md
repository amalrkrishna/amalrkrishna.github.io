<p align="justify">I went through my playlist once and picked out some songs whose lyrics meant a great deal to me. Most of these lines are very simple, all of it makes it into my list because: Either I liked the whole lyrics of the song or just the part I have mentioned, or I was able to relate to the lines in these lines somehow, or because of a movie or TV series I have watched, and some of these lines reciprocate the way I see the world. So, like I said, the list is just a personal one. :)</p>


<ol>
<li>All of Me, John Legend</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Love your curves and all your edges
    All your perfect imperfections
    Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
    You're my end and my beginning
    Even when I lose , I'm winning
    'Cause I give you all of me
    And you give me all of you, oh
{% endhighlight %}

<li>As long as you love me, Backstreet Boys</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
    I'm leavin' my life in your hands
    People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
    Risking it all in a glance
    And how you got me blind is still a mystery
    I can't get your out of my head
    Don't care what is written in your history
    As long as you're here with me
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Bad Day, Daniel Powter</li>
{% highlight css %}
    You stand in the line just ahead of the law
    You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
    You tell me your life's been way off line
    You're falling to pieces every time
    And I don't need no carryin' on
    Cause you had a bad day
    You're taking one down
    You sing a sad song just to turn it around
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Green Day</li>
{% highlight css %}
    My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
    My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
    Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
    Till then I walk alone
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Bring me to life, Evanescence</li>
{% highlight css %}
    How can you see into my eyes like open doors
    Leading you down into my core
    Where I've become so numb without a soul
    My spirit sleeping somewhere cold
    Until you find it there and lead it back home
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Comfortable Numb, Pink Floyd</li>
{% highlight css %}
    There is no pain, you are receding
    A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
    You are only coming though in waves
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Earth Song, Michael Jackson</li>
{% highlight css %}
    What about sunrise
    What about rain
    What about all the things
    That you said we were to gain...
    What about killing fields
    Is there a time
    What about all the things
    That you said was yours and mine...
    Did you ever stop to notice
    All the blood we've shed before
    Did you ever stop to notice
    The crying Earth the weeping shores?
{% endhighlight %}

<li>(Everything I Do) I Do It For You, Bryan Adams</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
    You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
    You know it's true
    Everything I do, I do it for you
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Fix You, Coldplay</li>
{% highlight css %}
    And high up above or down below
    When you're too in love to let it go
    But if you never try you'll never know
    Just what you're worth

    Lights will guide you home
    And ignite your bones
    And I will try to fix you
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Good Riddance, Green Day</li>
{% highlight css %}
    So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
    Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
    Tattoos and memories and dead skin on trial
    For what it's worth it was worth all the while

    It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
    I hope you had the time of your life
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Heal the World, Michael Jackson</li>
{% highlight css %}
    There's a place in your heart
    And I know that it is love
    And this place could be much
    Brighter than tomorrow
    And if you really try
    You'll find there's no need to cry
    In this place you'll feel
    There's no hurt or sorrow..
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Hey Jude, The Beatles</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Hey Jude, don't make it bad
    Take a sad song and make it better
    Remember to let her into your heart
    Then you can start to make it better
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Hotel California, Eagles</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Mirrors on the ceiling,
    The pink champagne on ice
    And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
    And in the master's chambers,
    They gathered for the feast
    They stab it with their steely knives,
    But they just can't kill the beast
{% endhighlight %}

<li>I'll Be There For You, The Rembrandts</li>
{% highlight css %}
    No one could ever know me
    No one could ever see me
    Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
    Someone to face the day with, make it through all the rest with
    Someone I'll always laugh with
    Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah!
{% endhighlight %}

<li>In The End, Linkin Park</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Time is a valuable thing
    Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
    Watch it count down to the end of the day
    The clock ticks life away
    It’s so unreal
    Didn’t look out below
    Watch the time go right out the window
    Trying to hold on but didn’t even know
    I wasted it all just to watch you go
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Is This love, Bob Marley</li>
{% highlight css %}
    I wanna love you and treat you right
    I wanna love you every day and every night
    We'll be together with a roof right over our heads
    We'll share the shelter of my single bed
    We'll share the same room, yeah! - for Jah provide the bread
    Is this love - is this love - is this love
    Is this love that I'm feelin'?
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Kashmir, Led Zeppelin</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Oh let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dream
    I am a traveler of both time and space, to be where I have been
    To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen
    They talk of days for which they sit and wait and all will be revealed
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Let It Be, The Beatles</li>
{% highlight css %}
    When I find myself in times of trouble
    Mother Mary comes to me
    Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
    And in my hour of darkness
    She is standing right in front of me
    Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Lose Yourself, Eminem</li>
{% highlight css %}
    You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
    You own it, you better never let it go
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Mad World, Gary Jules</li>
{% highlight css %}
    And I find it kinda funny
    I find it kinda sad
    The dreams in which I'm dying
    Are the best I've ever had
    I find it hard to tell you
    I find it hard to take
    When people run in circles
    It's a very, very mad world, mad world
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Nothing Else Matters, Metallica</li>
{% highlight css %}
    So close no matter how far
    Couldn't be much more from the heart
    Forever trusting who we are
    And nothing else matters

    Never cared for what they do
    Never cared for what they know
    But I know
{% endhighlight %}

<li>November Rain, Guns n' Roses</li>
{% highlight css %}
    'Cause nothin' lasts forever
    And we both know hearts can change
    And it's hard to hold a candle
    In the cold November rain
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Photograph, Ed Sheeran</li>
{% highlight css %}
    We keep this love in a photograph
    We made these memories for ourselves
    Where our eyes are never closing
    Hearts are never broken
    Times forever frozen still

    So you can keep me
    Inside the pocket
    Of your ripped jeans
    Holdin' me closer
    'Til our eyes meet
    You won't ever be alone
    Wait for me to come home
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Rolling in the Deep, Adele</li>
{% highlight css %}
    There's a fire starting in my heart
    Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
    Finally I can see you crystal clear
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Set fire to the Rain, Adele</li>
{% highlight css %}
    But I set fire to the rain,
    Watched it pour as I touched your face,
    Well, it burned while I cried
    'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Shadow of the Day, Linkin Park</li>
{% highlight css %}
    I close both locks below the window
    I close both blinds and turn away
    Sometimes solutions aren't so simple
    Sometimes goodbye's the only way
    And the sun will set for you
    The sun will set for you
    And the shadow of the day
    Will embrace the world in grey
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Show me the meaning of being lonely, Backstreet Boys</li>
{% highlight css %}
    So many words for the broken heart
    It's hard to see in a crimson love
    So hard to breathe
    Walk with me, and maybe
    Nights of light so soon become
    Wild and free I could feel the sun
    Your every wish will be done
    They tell me
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Somebody that I used to know, Gotye</li>
{% highlight css %}
    But you didn't have to cut me off
    Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
    And I don't even need your love
    But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
    No you didn't have to stoop so low
    Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
    I guess that I don't need that though
    Now you're just somebody that I used to know
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Stairway to Heaven, Led Zeppelin</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
    There’s still time to change the road you’re on
    And it makes me wonder
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Summer of 69, Bryan Adams</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Oh, when I look back now
    That summer seemed to last forever
    And if I had the choice
    Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
    Those were the best days of my life
{% endhighlight %}

<li>That's the way it is, Celine Dion</li>
{% highlight css %}
    When you want it the most there's no easy way out
    When you're ready to go and your heart's left in doubt
    Don't give up on your faith
    Love comes to those who believe it
    And that's the way it is

<li>Thinking out loud, Ed Sheeran</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Take me into your loving arms
    Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
    Place your head on my beating heart
    I'm thinking out loud
    Maybe we found love right where we are
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Time, Pink Floyd</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
    Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
    Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
    The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Viva La Vida, Coldplay</li>
{% highlight css %}
    I used to rule the world
    Seas would rise when I gave the word
    Now in the morning I sleep alone
    Sweep the streets I used to own
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Wake me up when September ends, Green Day</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Here comes the rain again
    Falling from the stars
    Drenched in my pain again
    Becoming who we are
    As my memory rests
    But never forgets what I lost
    Wake me up when September ends
{% endhighlight %}

<li>With or without you, U2</li>
{% highlight css %}
    See the stone set in your eyes
    See the thorn twist in your side
    I wait for you
    Sleight of hand and twist of fate
    On a bed of nails she makes me wait
    And I wait, without you
    With or without you
{% endhighlight %}

</ol>
