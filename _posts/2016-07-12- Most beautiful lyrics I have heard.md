<p align="justify">I went through my playlist once and picked out some songs whose lyrics meant a great deal to me. Most of these lines are very simple, all of it makes it into my list because: Either I liked the whole lyrics of the song or just the part I have mentioned, or I was able to relate to the lines in these lines somehow, or because of a movie or TV series I have watched, and some of these lines reciprocate the way I see the world. So, like I said, the list is just a personal one. :)</p>

<ol>
<li>All of Me, John Legend</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Love your curves and all your edges
    All your perfect imperfections
    Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
    You're my end and my beginning
    Even when I lose , I'm winning
    'Cause I give you all of me
    And you give me all of you, oh
{% endhighlight %}

<li>As long as you love me, Backstreet Boys</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
    I'm leavin' my life in your hands
    People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
    Risking it all in a glance
    And how you got me blind is still a mystery
    I can't get your out of my head
    Don't care what is written in your history
    As long as you're here with me
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Bad Day, Daniel Powter</li>
{% highlight css %}
    You stand in the line just ahead of the law
    You're faking a smile with the coffee you go
    You tell me your life's been way off line
    You're falling to pieces every time
    And I don't need no carryin' on
    Cause you had a bad day
    You're taking one down
    You sing a sad song just to turn it around
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Green Day</li>
{% highlight css %}
    My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
    My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
    Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
    Till then I walk alone
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Bring me to life, Evanescence</li>
{% highlight css %}
    How can you see into my eyes like open doors
    Leading you down into my core
    Where I've become so numb without a soul
    My spirit sleeping somewhere cold
    Until you find it there and lead it back home
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Comfortable Numb, Pink Floyd</li>
{% highlight css %}
    There is no pain, you are receding
    A distant ship's smoke on the horizon
    You are only coming though in waves
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Earth Song, Michael Jackson</li>
{% highlight css %}
    What about sunrise
    What about rain
    What about all the things
    That you said we were to gain...
    What about killing fields
    Is there a time
    What about all the things
    That you said was yours and mine...
    Did you ever stop to notice
    All the blood we've shed before
    Did you ever stop to notice
    The crying Earth the weeping shores?
{% endhighlight %}

<li>(Everything I Do) I Do It For You, Bryan Adams</li>
{% highlight css %}
    Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
    You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
    You know it's true
    Everything I do, I do it for you
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Fix You, Coldplay</li>
{% highlight css %}
    And high up above or down below
    When you're too in love to let it go
    But if you never try you'll never know
    Just what you're worth

    Lights will guide you home
    And ignite your bones
    And I will try to fix you
{% endhighlight %}

<li>Good Riddance, Green Day</li>
{% highlight css %}
    So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind
    Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time
    Tattoos and memories and dead skin on trial
    For what it's worth it was worth all the while

    It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right,
    I hope you had the time of your life
{% endhighlight %}
