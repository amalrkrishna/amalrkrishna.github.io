<p align="justify">I am writing this blog because today marks 6 months of my tutoring in Chegg Tutors (started on May 30th). Now, you will be wondering what's Chegg Tutors right?. Chegg Tutors is an online tutoring website that matches students who need help with online tutors. Students can receive help either on-demand or by scheduling a lesson. InstaEDU was founded in 2011 and launched into public beta in May 2012. On June 3, 2014, Chegg announced that it purchased InstaEDU for $30 million in cash, and that it plans to keep the InstaEDU service active as Chegg Tutors.<br>

Now, I came across Chegg Tutors in my final year at college. Some of my classmates started using the service to tutor students online and they were making quite alot of money from it. Obviously, this made me interested and I applied to Chegg Tutors. Chegg Tutor pays tutor's 20$ per hour, which I suppose is a fairly very good deal. During peak months, Chegg sometimes raises this amount to 30$ per hour to encourage tutors to take up more questions. In my 6 months in Chegg this occured twice in the month of June if my memory is correct.
