<p align="justify">I have mainly concentrated my research work under Software Defined Networking and Delay Tolerant Networking domains. Recently I have also started to develop a strong interest towards Data Science and it's potential applications in Computer Networks. My long term goal is to expand my knowledge under SDN and data-driven networks such as Cognitive Networks and Self-healing Networks.</p>

<i class="fa fa-search"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank">On Switch-based Controller Hand-offs in Software Defined Wireless Mesh Networks</a></strong> <br/>
<p align="justify">We use Expected Transmission Time (ETT) as the metric for controller hand-off in OpenFlow WMNs. ETT reflects various physical-layer characteristics, such as link traffic and end-to-end bandwidth. The experimental results showed that ETT is a better metric compared to RTT and ETX in a dynamic network with variable load across the links. ETT-based hand-off is able to respond to the excessive load in the link and make suitable hand-off decisons, whereas RTT and ETX fails in accomplishing the same with lower hand-off delay and packet dropouts.<br>

<p align="justify">Software Defined MICRONet (Mobile Infrastructure for Costal Region Offshore Communications and Networks) architecture provides intelligent communication among physical boat clusters in the sea. This will solve the technology challenges faced by the fishermen community in India today, specifically by providing software defined Intelligent and adaptable communication and connectivity while they are out at sea. A scaled down model of Software Defined MICRONet environment was emulated in a testbed and meaningful results were obtained.<br>

<p align="justify">Analyzed the challenges of Software Defined Network (SDN) in a high delay environment. An Software Defined Delay Tolerant Network (SDDTN) module is deployed onto every switch using OpenFlow protocol which gets activated when there is an absence of main controller connection. The module act as a light-weight controller which generates the flow for the switch and compute the plausible locations to store the packets in the isolated network.<br>Final Report : <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7qfuVtugGPOZ2FURXNfaXlELXc">View here</a></p><br>

<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank">Navigation in a Virtual Environment using IMU MPU-6050 (2015)</i></a></strong> <br/> 
<p align="justify">Head Mounted Display(HMD) is one of the revolutionary Virtual Reality(VR) inventions of all times. But how do you move around in a Virtual Environment?. For a true VR experience you need to move around freely and naturally. Imagine a game where the user can freely roam around their backyard or walk on a frictionless surface and navigate in a virtual environment rather than sitting idle in a chair. Similarly, there are a ton of applications from taking a morning walk in a VR world to a whole range of simulation training for combat soldiers. Developing a low-cost system for such a VR experience which can be implemented onto a HMD, is always a challenge. In this project we have done a hardware implementation to navigate in a virtual environment using a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU).<br>

<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank">2D convolution using Xlinix of a 128*128 window and by using a 3*3 convolution matrix (2014)</a></strong> <br/>
<p align="justify">For each input pixel window, the values in that window are multiplied by the convolution mask. Next, those results are added together and divided by the number of pixels in the window. This value is the output for the origin pixel of the output image for that position. The input pixel window is always the same size as the convolution mask. The output pixel is rounded to the nearest integer. The results for this algorithm carried over an entire input image will result in an output image with reduced salt-and-pepper noise. An important aspect of the convolution algorithm is that it supports a virtually infinite variety of masks, each with its own feature. This flexibility allows for many powerful uses.</p>

<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank">Student-Faculty web portal in PHP framework (2013)</a></strong> <br/>
<p align="justify">It is a web-based portal. That is more beneficial to both students and teachers. It enacting as a bridge of communication amongst students and faculties in colleges and universities. It is a user-friendly, GUI based client / server application that will helps the users for storing, retrieving and sharing resources through online. Faculties can easily share the resources attachments through online. This application can also helps the users to evaluate the tests performed by the students, store the marks and generate the mark reports. It also provides a chat facility between the students and faculty so that when they both online at same time they can directly communicate with each other comments query and doubts can also be cleared by providing a text area.</p>
