<p align="justify">I am 22 years old. I love watching movies, music videos, and TV shows. I am also highly passionate about Graphic designing and I am an active follower of Quora. One F.R.I.E.N.D.S episode a day makes my day complete. I usually sleep very late at night, if you are an Indian and follows international football, you know the difficulty! I was brought up in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. I attended St Thomas Higher Secondary School and St Thomas Central School for my higher secondary education. My failures have motivated me more than my achievements. I am usually good at working under pressure with an upcoming deadline to meet.</p>

<p align="justify">I started out my B-Tech as an Avionics Engineering student at IIST~as I speak IIST is ranked as the 8th best university in India by the MHRD, Govt of India. I had to wait till my 3rd year in college to discover my interest in Computer Science and subsequently Computer Networks. From then I took up electives related to Computer Science and diverted my area of studies. I did my Internship and my Final year project on Software Defined Networking at Indian Insititute of Space Science and Technology under <strong><a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj" target="_blank">B.S. Manoj <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></strong>. I came across open source projects such as <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/openflow" target="_blank">OpenFlow <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and <a href="http://openvswitch.org/" target="_blank">Open vSwitch <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> during my Internship and Final year project. I was fascinated by and interested in the working methods of the Opensource community as a result and strive to be a part of it to my abilities.</p>
