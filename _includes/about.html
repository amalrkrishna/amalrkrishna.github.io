<i class="fa fa-user"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a target="_blank">Biography</a></strong> <br/>
<p align="justify">I am 22 years old. I love watching movies and TV shows (not your every-day movie/tv show fan, I have an offline database of 2TB+ specifically for this) and listen to Rock/EDM music. I am also highly passionate about Graphic designing and I am an active follower of Quora. One F.R.I.E.N.D.S episode a day makes my day complete. I usually sleep very late at night, if you are an Indian and follows international football, you know the difficulty! I was brought up in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. I attended St Thomas Higher Secondary School and St Thomas Central School for my higher secondary education. My failures have motivated me more than my achievements. I am usually good at working under pressure with an upcoming deadline to meet. Recently, I have also started living more in the moment and gathered courage to take risks.</p>

<p align="justify">I did my Bachelor's degreee in Avionics Engineering at Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology~as I speak IIST is ranked as the 8th best university in India by the MHRD, Govt of India. In my 3rd year in college I became passionate about Computer Science and subsequently Computer Networks. From then I took up electives related to Computer Science and diverted my area of studies from Avionics. I did my Internship and my Final year project on Software Defined Networking at IIST under <strong><a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/bsmanoj" target="_blank">B.S. Manoj <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></strong>. I came across open source projects such as OpenFlow <a href="https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/openflow" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> and Open vSwitch <a href="http://openvswitch.org/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a> during my Internship and Final year project. I am also fascinated by and interested in the working methods of the Opensource community. As a result, I strive to be a part of it some day. I worked as a Research Associate in UpX Academy, startup ventured under Tech Mahindra. Here I concentrated on Data Science and Big Data technologies. My long term goal is to expand my knowledge under SDN, Data-driven networks such as Cognitive Networks and Self-healing Networks, incorporating my Interdisciplinary knowledge from Networks and Data Science.</p>
