            <h1>Software Defined MICRONet (Mobile Infrastructure for Costal Region Offshore Communications and Networks)</h1>
        </header>
	<p align="justify">Software Defined MICRONet architecture provides intelligent communication among physical boat clusters in the sea. This will solve the technology challenges faced by the fishermen community in India today, specifically by providing software defined Intelligent and adaptable communication and connectivity while they are out at sea. A scaled down model of Software Defined MICRONet environment was emulated in a testbed and meaningful results were obtained.
